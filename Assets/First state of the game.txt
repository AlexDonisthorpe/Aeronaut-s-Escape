You awake in a prison cell, still fully clothed, yet your weapon and additional effects have been taken from you. 
Outside the cell you can see a guard patrolling the hallway beyond at regular intervals. 
Searching your person, you realise that they didn't check your boots for your custom lockpics, the "Lockpic Deluxxxx" set,
(only inferior to the newly released Lockpic Deluxxxxx set available for pre-purchase at your local fence dealer!).

What do you do?
1. Lockpick the cell door intermittently avoiding the guard.
2. Call the guard over.
