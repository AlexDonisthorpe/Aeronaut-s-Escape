  storyText: "You sneak around the side of the dock and slip into the water. So far
    so good as you swim out towards the ships far side. as you swim past the ships
    bow you notice that there's another pier extending to another nearby ship. Not
    intially a problem, however as you continue to swim you can see that there's someone
    working on that pier, and they're walking to where they'll get a clear look at
    you.\r\n\r\nIf you're quick you might be able to swim up to the pier and yank
    him in, just like the movies!\r\n\r\nOr you can dive briefly, before quitely climbing
    the side of the ship.\r\n\r\n1. Attack the worker\r\n2. Dive! Dive! Dive!"
