  storyText: "It doesn't take long for the corridor to open out into a large cave
    like area. You appear to be in some form of underground dock for cargo ships!\r\n\r\nLooking
    around you can see some workers working on the dock nearby a fairly empty cargo
    ship. It looks like it's nearly ready to depart, having offloaded its goods.\r\n\r\nYou
    may be able to convince the workers to stow you away on board, or you can swim
    around the ship and climb aboard.\r\n\r\n1. Approach the Sailors\r\n2. Swim around!"
