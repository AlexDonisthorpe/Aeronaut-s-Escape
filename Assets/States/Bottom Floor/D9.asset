  storyText: "You turn the door in sequence and at first nothing happens. Just as
    you begin to suspect the other option was the better idea, you hear a resounding
    click. Slowly the door begins to unlock, unveiling a small alcove with a pedestal
    inside.\r\n\r\nLooking upon the pedestal you see a strange device, it looks like
    some sort of wristband with a clunky clothface attached, but the clockface is
    embedded in some form of jeweled material.\r\n\r\nWait. This is a teleport-o-max-10k.
    They're single use devices for the most part (they require a new steamjewel every
    teleport but it means you can teleport wherever you like in the world given the
    right coordinates.\n\n1. Get out of here!"
