  storyText: "You wander over to the lever to the side of the door you're at. It looks
    like someone has chained a padlock around the base of the lever. Ironically, it
    seems they weren't particularly smart in doing so. You proceed to pull the lever
    unimpeded by the padlock and chains.\r\n\r\nThe bridge itself begins to slowly
    turn towards you, providing a way to reach the door on the other end of the room."
