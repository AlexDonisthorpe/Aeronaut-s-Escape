  storyText: "It takes you a little while to climb up onto the bridge rotation mechanism
    but once you're in a suitable position you decide to make the jump...\r\n\r\nSuccess!
    You've grabbed onto the lantern chain! You're able to use your weight to generate
    swing momentum, after you're sure you've got enough momentum you leap for the
    far ledge. Nearby is another lever, you pull it, and the bridge rotates to cross
    the room. What a weird room.\n\n1. Continue"
