  storyText: "As you begin to jump across the pillars you start to feel more comfortable
    in your abilities. As you reach the center of the room you scramble your way up
    onto the bridge and look down the other side, to your left there seems to be a
    lowered section of the far platform that looks fairly easy to reach, but you'll
    have to make your way down on some pillars and swim across a small portion of
    the water below.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if you climb up onto part of the bridge
    mechanism, you think you can grab onto a chain supporting a lamp hanging from
    the ceiling, in order to swing yourself across the remaining section.\r\n\n1.
    Swing\r\n2. Swim"
