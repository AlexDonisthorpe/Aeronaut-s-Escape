  storyText: "Ahh interesting! It's a whirlycog Thingomajic 2000! These models do
    come with keys, but there's numerous health and saftey issues with this model,
    but from memory there was a weird way to bypass this lock Supposedly if you turn
    the primary cog rigt, left and then right again...or wait...was it left, right
    and then right? One of those will open the lock as a security override feature.
    Ahh but, doing it the wrong way...You can't remember what happens...\r\n\r\n1.
    Right, Left and then Right?\r\n2. Left, Right and then Left?"
