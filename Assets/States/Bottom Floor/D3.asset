  storyText: "You follow the corridor down to the right, it's incredibly dark with
    no daylight to be seen anywhere, but a few torches have been lit every ten meters
    or so.\r\n\r\nEventually you arrive in a large open room, you stand on the edge
    of a small platform overlooking a basin filled with water. the water looks strange
    though, like there's something swimming in it, but it's too dark to get a good
    look.\r\n\r\nIn the center of the room there looks to be a strange bridge over
    the gap, but it has been built on top of a mechanism and is extending across the
    room adjacent to you, rather than forming a bridge from this side to the next.
    Looking around you can see a lever on the right side of the room. But to your
    left there looks like there's some small pillars sticking out of the floor, you
    may be able to jump across those if you're feeling nimble.\r\n\r\n1. The lever\r\n2.
    Jump the pillars"
