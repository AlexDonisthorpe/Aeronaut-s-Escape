  storyText: "You throw yourself under the waves and slowly make your way towards
    the ship, as you get closer you spy the anchor and decide to use it to both hide
    behind and to climb up onto the deck of the ship.\r\n\r\nYou quickly scramble
    to the lower decks and look around, there's a few places you could probably stow
    yourself for the time being, there's a barrel in the corner,  only a quarter full
    but there's room for you in there. Additionally in another corner there appears
    to be a load of stacked crates, with some room behind it, maybe there's something
    back there?\r\n\r\nYou hear footsteps on deck, time to make a choice.\r\n\r\n1.
    Dive into the Barrel!\r\n2. Jump behind the crates!"
