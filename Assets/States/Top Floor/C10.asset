  storyText: "Taking a runup to the ship you barrel across the deck and push the first
    unsuspecting victim off the ship. Good start, but your luck doesn't last long,
    you're suddenly surrounded by the remaining crew, and your attempts at brawling
    your way out and met with a swift punch to the just and a backhand to the face.
    Your crumple to the floor as the captain approaches.\r\n\r\n\"I've just lost one
    good man to your antics, I am however not an unreasonable man. You can pledge
    your loyalty to me here and now, or we can throw you off the ship and you can
    meet your maker.\r\n\r\n1. Attack the captain!\r\n2. Choose death!\r\n3. Swear
    fealty."
