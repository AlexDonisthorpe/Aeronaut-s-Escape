  storyText: "In a daring attempt to make this man pay for your incarceration you
    smash through the thin window pane, grab a carving knife from a pork dish nearby
    and hold it to the mans throat.\r\n\r\nThe room freezes, all the guards stop in
    their tracks and the duke whispers to you quivering... \"I'll do anything, give
    you anything, let me go and you can leave! take the airship! just don't kill me!\"\r\n\r\n1.
    Let the duke go, and try to barter an agreement.\r\n2. Slowly move yourself towards
    the far doors with the duke in tow."
