  storyText: "You look out the open window and realise for the first time you're in
    a tower, on a small island, surrounded by the sea. You don't remember getting
    here but you'd like to get out.\r\n\r\nLooking around, you see if you jump after
    a significant drop you see there might be a good place to land, maybe you can
    swim to the harbour from there.\r\n\r\nEqually, you might be able to climb around
    the tower by stepping out of the window and hanging on for life, you can see the
    airship not too far away.\r\n\r\n1. Jump\r\n2. Climbing time!"
