  storyText: "You make up your mind quickly, and immediately sprint towards the duke.
    You leap over the table, grabbing a nearby carving knife and bring yourself up
    behind the duke.\r\n\r\nThe room freezes, all the guards stop in their\r\ntracks
    and the duke whispers to you quivering... \"I'll do anything, give\r\nyou anything,
    let me go and you can leave! take the airship! just don't\r\nkill me!\"\r\n\r\n1.
    Let the duke go, and try to barter an agreement.\r\n2. Slowly move yourself towards
    the far doors with the duke in tow."
