  storyText: "You dive behind the crates just in time. Lucky too, as the man with
    the beard walks straight over to the barrel and drops a mug in there before fishing
    it out, full of some sticky liquid. He then heads back up on deck, looking very
    proud of himself.\r\n\r\nYou look around at your surroundings and realise you've
    hit the jackpot! In the corner there's a ringpull into a smaller compartment,
    probably a smugglers hideaway. Opening it up reveals there's nothing inside, great
    news! no one will be looking in here! and the crates are filled with food and
    drinks, there's an abundance here, you don't think they'll miss a few bits going
    to a good cause!\r\n\r\nYou settle in for a peaceful ride out of this place!\n\n1.
