  storyText: 'As you slowly hop your way down to the water, you try to get a closer
    look into it, but it''s pitch black. You decide it''s likely just water and a
    small swim should be fine until you jump in. At first everything is fine, the
    water is a bit cold, however after swimming for a short while you feel something
