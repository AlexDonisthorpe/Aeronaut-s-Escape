  storyText: "You quickly swim to the side of the pier, wait cautiously for the man
    to come closer, then leap up and grab his legs, toppling him off the side and
    into the water.\r\n\r\nYou quickly attempt to establish a headlock, however you
    now have a good look at the man, he appears to be quite muscular and toned, and
    doesn't in the slightest look panicked.\r\n\r\nYour opponent also appeared to
    be trained in underwater combat. You consider this as he puts you into a headlock
    of his own.\n\n1. Continue"
