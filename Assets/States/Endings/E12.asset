  storyText: "You take stock of the situation and decide there's only one realistic
    way out of this intact.\r\nYou swear fealty to the captain, who immediately starts
    issuing orders.\r\n\r\n\"This runt was probably a lucky prisoner here, so lets
    lock him in the brig for now. Then we'll deal with him later. For now let's finish
    robbing this duke blind and get out of here\"\r\n\r\nThe crew grin in unison and
    you are escorted below deck into a locked room.\r\n\r\nAs night falls you hear
    shouting, gunshots and the clinking of steel, followed by the airship booming
    into motion.\r\n\r\nI guess you're a pirate now?\n\n1. Continue"
