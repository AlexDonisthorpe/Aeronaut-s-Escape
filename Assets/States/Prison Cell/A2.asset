  storyText: "Looking out the window, the smell of the sea hits you like a truck long
    before you look down and realise there's no land to be seen.\r\n\r\nArching your
    neck down, you can just about make out what looks like a small harbour down below
    with some ships.\r\n\r\nYou hear a noise from above you and reactively look up.
    The sound was the unfurling of the windsails of an airship! Aha! perhaps a more
    fitting escape for an Aeronaut, but perhaps also the more obvious one.\r\n\r\nYou
    turn back to your cell, you still have to decide how to get out of here...\r\n\r\n1.
    Pick the lock\r\n2. Call the guard."
