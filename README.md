# Aeronaut-s-Escape
A steampunk choose-your-own-adventure text-based game
This game was designed and built alongside GameDev.tv's Course: [Complete C# Unity Developer 2D: Learn to Code Making Games](https://www.gamedev.tv/p/complete-unity-developer-2d)

## Goals

* Develop a working prototype of a text-adventure game.
* To get familiar with the Unity UI and associated game objects used by the engine.
* Start learning C# within Unity.
* Create a basic game whereby the text would update based on player input.
* Implement a number of different areas and endings within the game providing limited replayability as players explored each area.

## The game

I'm unable to host the game here on github but here's a [playable link!](https://simmer.io/@Tenlaael/~b3bd5c3f-8c0c-9740-84a8-ebc6054d4d80)
